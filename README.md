After visiting awesome-datascience link, I was most intrigued by NYC Taxi data, please see link below: https://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/
Data visualization on the web site portrays a single day of a NYC cab, its earnings, routes, and levels of the workload. After following a cab for 24 hours you will be able to see what areas of the city were most frequently visited, how full the car was and what were the peak hours of the business. This data set may be used by numerous agencies starting with taxi dispatches and ending up with environmental scientist. Cab dispatches may use this set to pinpoint most popular areas where the cab services were requested and strategize initial cab placement there to maximize driver’s productivity and to increase revenue. Environmental scientist may use this data to track carbon footprint of a single vehicle and create alternative and more eco-friendly routes for the cab to use moving forward.  

Every student studying Big Data Analytics should definitely read an “Introduction to Metadata” book written by Murtha Baca. For your convenience you may access the book here: https://www.getty.edu/publications/intrometadata/
The book provides fundamentals of overall metadata’s concepts, its application and leads towards the path for further research and study. Not only the author touches on the basics of metadata (its types and roles) but also discusses its relationships with the Web, covering tools and resources available to put apart and to study data.
